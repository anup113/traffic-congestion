# vehicle_detection_and_congestion_mapping
Vehicle Detection and Road Traffic Congestion Mapping system enables people to find information about the traffic congestion throughout the city. An image processing mechanism is used for detecting road traffic congestion by processing traffic video stream. The traffic congestion data is collected and uploaded on a Raspberry Pi web server. The obtained data is displayed on the Google map through a website and made available to the end users.
